2506.10938v1,From Fractionalization to Chiral Topological Superconductivity in Flat Chern Band,Daniele Guerci,2025-06-12,"We show that interacting electrons in a flat Chern band can form, in addition to fractional Chern insulators, a chiral $f$-wave topological superconductor that hosts neutral Majorana fermion edge modes. Superconductivity emerges from an interaction-induced metallic state that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, as observed in rhombohedral graphene and near the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10938v1
2506.10670v1,Above 20K conventional superconductivity in Cerium,Mohd Monish,2025-06-12,"A high superconducting critical temperature (Tc) under normal laboratory conditions in a material that is chemically simple and stable, like an elemental metal, is a hitherto unattained goal of modern science and technology. Certain elemental metals are known to display reasonably high Tc only under extraordinarily high pressures where their spectroscopic characterization and application are tightly restricted. Here we show that a Tc exceeding 20 K can be realized on pure elemental Ce under uniaxial pressure created simply by pressing a sharp metallic needle on the metal. This is a breakthrough because pure Ce does not superconduct under ambient conditions and the application of 54 GPa of hydrostatic pressure yields only a low Tc of 1.8 K in the metal. In addition, by driving the area under the needle in a mechanically controlled way to the ballistic transport regime, for the first time, we spectroscopically characterized the superconducting energy gap in a high-pressure superconducting phase and found that superconducting Ce respects the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10670v1
2506.10590v1,Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets,Pei-Hao Fu,2025-06-12,"The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena Using Floquet formalism, we reveal multiple spin-degenerate nodes in the Floquet spin density, which can be dissected into single- and double-photon processes, and connected to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Notably, both odd- and even-frequency spin-triplet pairs can be generated by the interplay between the driving field and the unconventional magnetism. Moreover, the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of the unconventional magnet allows linearly polarized light to control magnetic and polarization directions. By tuning the driving amplitude, frequency, and polarization, Floquet spin density and pairing amplitude can be dynamically controlled, offering promising applications in Floquet engineering spintronic and superconducting devices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10590v1

Anand,2025-06-12,"${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$ which crystallizes in ${\rm ThCr_2Si_2}$-type body-centered tetragonal structure exhibits superconductivity below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c} = 1.69$~K\@. We have investigated the superconducting gap structure and time reversal symmetry of the ground state in ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$ by means of muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our analysis of $\mu$SR data collected in transverse magnetic field reveals BCS superconductivity with a single-band $s$-wave singlet pairing and an isotropic energy gap having the value $2\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} = 3.50(1)$. Further, an increased relaxation rate in zero field $\mu$SR asymmetry spectra below $T_{\rm c} $ provides evidence for the presence of a spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting state revealing that the time-reversal symmetry is broken in ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10432v1
2506.10262v1,Topotactic oxidation of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reveals new structural family: oxygen-intercalated layered perovskites,Dan Ferenc Segedin,2025-06-12,"Layered perovskites such as the Dion-Jacobson, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Aurivillius families host a wide range of correlated electron phenomena, from high-temperature superconductivity to multiferroicity. Here we report a new family of layered perovskites, realized through topotactic oxygen intercalation of La_{n+1}Ni_{n}O_{3n+1} (n=1-4) Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate thin films grown by ozone-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. Post-growth ozone annealing induces a large c-axis expansion - 17.8% for La_{2}NiO_{4} (n=1) - that monotonically decreases with increasing n. Surface X-ray diffraction coupled with Coherent Bragg Rod Analysis reveals that this structural expansion arises from the intercalation of approximately 0.7 oxygen atoms per formula unit into interstitial sites within the rock salt spacer layers. The resulting structures exhibit a spacer layer composition intermediate between that of the Ruddlesden-Popper and Aurivillius phases, defining a new class of layered perovskites. Oxygen-intercalated nickelates exhibit metallicity and significantly enhanced nickel-oxygen hybridization, a feature linked to high-temperature superconductivity. Our work establishes topotactic oxidation as a powerful synthetic approach to accessing highly oxidized, metastable phases across a broad range of layered oxide systems, offering new platforms to tune properties via spacer-layer chemistry.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10262v1
2506.09925v1,Emergent anisotropic three-phase order in critically doped superconducting diamond films,Jyotirmay Dwivedi,2025-06-11,"Two decades since its discovery, superconducting heavily boron-doped diamond (HBDD) still presents unresolved fundamental questions whose resolution is relevant to the development of this material for quantum technologies. We use electrical magnetotransport measurements of critically-doped homoepitaxial single crystal HBDD films to reveal signatures of intrinsic (electronic) granular superconductivity. By studying the dependence of electrical resistivity on temperature and magnetic field vector, we infer that this granularity arises from electron correlations. This is revealed by a striking three-phase anisotropy in the magnetoresistance, accompanied by a spontaneous transverse voltage (Hall anomaly). Our findings indicate an emergent magnetically tunable intrinsic order in an otherwise isotropic three dimensional single crystal HBDD film, offering new insights into the mechanism of superconductivity in this quantum material.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09925v1
2506.09864v1,"Unusual electron correlations in Kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A= K, Rb, Cs)",Feihu Liu,2025-06-11,"The investigation of electronic order-quantum phase interplay in Kagome lattices commonly employs the extended Kagome-Hubbard model, where the critical parameters comprise on-site $(U)$ and intersite $(V)$ Coulomb interactions. In prototypical kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), the geometrically frustrated quasi-2D architecture induces pressure-dependent complexity in vanadium d-electron correlations, necessitating systematic theoretical scrutiny. Utilizing the $d-dp$ model within constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we quantified $U$, $V$, and Hund's coupling $J$ under hydrostatic pressure (0-9 GPa). While $KV_3Sb_5$ and $RbV_3Sb_5$ exhibit pressure-insensitive interaction parameters, $CsV_3Sb_5$ manifests anomalous discontinuities in $U$ and $V$ near $0.2$ GPa, suggesting a first-order electronic phase transition. This work establishes cRPA-derived interaction landscapes as critical predictors for pressure-tunable quantum phenomena in correlated kagome systems, offers a new insight into the understanding of the interplay between the CDW transition and the double superconductivity dome in $CsV_3Sb_5$ at low pressure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09864v1
2506.09725v1,Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface,Tingyu Zhang,2025-06-11,"We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09725v1

We employ high-energy electron irradiation to induce disorder in superconducting Nd$_{0.825}$Sr$_{0.175}$NiO$_2$ thin films and examine the impact of pair-breaking defects on superconductivity and elucidate the nature of the superconducting gap.

2506.09413v1,Ising superconductivity in bulk layered non-centrosymmetric 4H-NbSe2,Chandan Patra,2025-06-11,"Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit multiple polymorphs that enable the exploration of diverse quantum states, including valley-selective spin polarization, the valley Hall effect, Ising superconductivity, and nontrivial topology. Monolayer 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ is a promising candidate for realizing Ising superconductivity due to its spin-split, out-of-plane spin-polarized states arising from inversion symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling. In contrast, bulk 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ retains inversion symmetry and lacks spin splitting, limiting its suitability for hosting Ising superconductivity. Here, we report the growth of high-quality single crystals of the acentric bulk superconducting polymorph, 4$H$-NbSe$_2$, which intrinsically breaks the inversion symmetry and supports valley-selective spin-polarized states. Magnetization and resistivity measurements reveal anisotropic superconductivity, with the in-plane upper critical field exceeding the Pauli limit, while out-of-plane fields suppress superconductivity more rapidly, before reaching the Pauli limit, which strongly suggests the presence of Ising pairing. First-principles calculations and symmetry analysis confirm significant valley-selective spin splitting with out-of-plane spin polarization, further supporting the emergence of Ising superconductivity in 4$H$-NbSe$_2$. These results establish 4$H$-NbSe$_2$ as a robust bulk platform to investigate Ising superconductivity and valley-selective phenomena in transition-metal dichalcogenides.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09413v1
2506.08985v1,Tuning the the fundamental periodicity of the current-phase relation in multiterminal diffusive Josephson junctions,Venkat Chandrasekhar,2025-06-10,"Conventional superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions, devices where two superconductors are separated by a tunnel barrier are technologically important as elements in quantum circuits, particularly with their key role in superconducting qubits. An important characteristic of Josephson junctions is the relation between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference {\phi} between them. For SIS junctions, the current-phase relation is sinusioidal and 2{\pi} periodic. Other types of Josephson junctions, where the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N) may have non-sinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2{\pi} periodic. We show here that a multi-terminal diffusive SNS Josephson junction with 4 superconducting contacts can show a current phase relation between two of the contacts that is a superposition of 2{\pi} and 4{\pi} periodic components whose relative strength is controlled by the phase difference between the other two contacts, becoming 2{\pi} or 4{\pi} periodic for certain values of this phase difference. This tunability might have applications in tailoring the Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuits.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08985v1
2506.08984v1,Giant transverse magnetic fluctuations at the edge of re-entrant superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$,Valeska Zambra,2025-06-10,"UTe$_{2}$ exhibits the remarkable phenomenon of re-entrant superconductivity, whereby the zero-resistance state reappears above 40 tesla after being suppressed with a field of around 10 tesla. One potential pairing mechanism, invoked in the related re-entrant superconductors UCoGe and URhGe, involves transverse fluctuations of a ferromagnetic order parameter. However, the requisite ferromagnetic order - present in both UCoGe and URhGe - is absent in UTe$_{2}$, and magnetization measurements show no sign of strong fluctuations. Here, we measure the magnetotropic susceptibility of UTe$_{2}$ across two field-angle planes. This quantity is sensitive to the magnetic susceptibility in a direction transverse to the applied magnetic field - a quantity that is not accessed in conventional magnetization measurements. We observe a very large decrease in the magnetotropic susceptibility over a broad range of field orientations, indicating a large increase in the transverse magnetic susceptibility. The three superconducting phases of UTe$_{2}$, including the high-field re-entrant phase, surround this region of enhanced susceptibility in the field-angle phase diagram. The strongest transverse susceptibility is found near the critical end point of the high-field metamagnetic transition, suggesting that quantum critical fluctuations of a field-induced magnetic order parameter may be responsible for the large transverse susceptibility, and may provide a pairing mechanism for field-induced superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08984v1
2506.08873v1,Identifying vortex lattice in type-II superconductors via the dynamic magnetostrictive effect,Peipei Lu,2025-06-10,"In type-I superconductors, zero electrical resistivity and perfect diamagnetism define two fundamental criteria for superconducting behavior. In contrast, type-II superconductors exhibit more complex mixed-state physics, where magnetic flux penetrates the material above the lower critical field Hc1 in the form of quantized vortices, each carrying a single flux quantum. These vortices form a two-dimensional lattice which persists up to another irreversible field (Hirr) and then melts into a dissipative liquid phase. The vortex lattice is fundamental to the magnetic and electrical properties of type-II superconductors, a third definitive criterion-beyond resistivity and magnetization-for identifying this phase has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a dynamic magnetostrictive effect, wherein the geometry of the superconductor oscillates only under an applied alternating magnetic field due to the disturbance of the vortex lattice. This effect is detected by a thin piezoelectric transducer, which converts the excited geometric deformation into an in-phase ac voltage. Notably, we find a direct and nearly linear relationship between the signal amplitude and the vortex density in lattice across several representative type-II superconductors. In the vortex liquid phase above Hirr, the signal amplitude rapidly decays to zero near the upper critical field (Hc2), accompanied by a pronounced out-of-phase component due to enhanced dissipation. This dynamic magnetostrictive effect not only reveals an unexplored magnetoelastic property of the vortex lattice but also establishes a fundamental criterion for identifying the type-II superconductors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08873v1
2506.08763v1,"Enhanced superconducting gap in the outer CuO$_2$ plane of the trilayer cuprate (Hg,Re)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+Î´}$",M. Horio,2025-06-10,"We report the first observation of a momentum-resolved superconducting gap in the Hg-based trilayer cuprate, which holds the highest record of superconducting transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) at ambient pressure. By angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy utilizing a micro-focused beam, clear quasiparticle dispersions originating from the inner and outer CuO$_2$ planes (IP and OP, respectively) were separately identified. The magnitude of the superconducting gap for the IP was comparable to that of the Bi-based trilayer cuprate with a lower $T_\mathrm{c}$. In contrast, the superconducting gap for the OP was significantly larger than that of the Bi-based one. While strong pairing in the IP has been highlighted as the key element of trilayer cuprates, the present results suggest that the enhanced pairing energy in the OP is essential for the highest $T_\mathrm{c}$ at ambient pressure realized in the Hg-based trilayer cuprate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08763v1
2506.08657v1,Trotter transition in BCS pairing dynamics,Aniket Patra,2025-06-10,"We Trotterize the mean-field dynamics of the integrable BCS model using symplectic integrators. The resulting chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large $\tau$ limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08657v1
2506.08501v1,Observation of Uniform Supercurrent Flow in Polycrystalline K-doped Ba122 by Combined Magneto-optical Imaging and Finite-element Modeling,Shota Ishiwata,2025-06-10,"Macroscopic current uniformity in a (Ba,K)Fe2As2 bulk sample produced by a process that demonstrated high trapped magnetic fields was evaluated through a comparative experimental and modeling approach. The bulk sample, with a well-defined square geometry, exhibited ideal roof-top patterns in magneto-optical (MO) images. Comparison of the magnetic moment, MO images, and finite element modeling results showed good agreement for the critical current density, suggesting that the supercurrent circulates uniformly throughout the sample on the order of MO resolution. These results highlight the importance of enhancing flux pinning strength and microstructural control at the submicron and grain boundary scale in iron-based superconducting polycrystalline materials.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08501v1
2506.08468v1,Vortices in Two-Dimensional Chiral Superfluids,Yan He,2025-06-10,"We study the orbital angular momentum (OAM) $L_z$ of two-dimensional chiral $(p_x+ip_y)^{\nu}$-wave superfluids (SFs) in the presence of an axisymmetric multiply quantized vortex (MQV) with vorticity $k$ on a disk at zero temperature, in the framework of Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) theory. Focusing on spectral asymmetry (or spectral flow), we find that $L_z=(k+\nu)N/2$ for any integer $\nu$ and $k$ in the Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) regime, where $N$ is the total number of fermions. While in the weak-pairing Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) regime, only for chiral $p+ip$-wave SF with $k=\pm 1$, $L_z=(k+\nu)N/2$ still holds. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$ or $|k|\ge2$ in the BCS regime, the OAM $L_z$ is remarkably reduced from its ``full"" value in the BEC regime. However, the deviations differ in these two cases. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$, $L_z$ is sharply suppressed in this ideal setting with a specular wall, while the suppression caused by the $|k| \ge 2$ vortex is moderate, which is core-size dependent. Furthermore, for $p+ip$-wave SF with $k=-1$, the total OAM $L_z$ is zero, but the distribution $L_z(r)$ is nontrivial compared with that of vortex-free $s$-wave SF, in which the total OAM is zero as well. For chiral SFs with $\nu\ge2$ and $|k|\ge2$, the effects of circulation due to vortex and chiral pairing can coexist, and hence depress the OAM simultaneously. These observations can be explained by spectral asymmetry and unpaired fermions in the ground state of the BdG Hamiltonian. We also investigate the spatial distribution of particle density, OAM, by solving the BdG equation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08468v1
2506.08402v1,Exciton condensation from level repulsion: application to bilayer graphene,Harley D. Scammell,2025-06-10,"Exciton condensation in semiconductors and semimetals has long been predicted but remains elusive. In a semiconductor, condensation occurs when the exciton binding energy matches the band gap. This binding energy results from a balance between Coulomb attraction, which enhances it, and kinetic energy, which suppresses it. However, reducing kinetic energy typically increases screening, weakening Coulomb attraction. Empirically, in most candidate materials, the binding energy remains below the band gap, with few external parameters capable of altering this balance. Here, we propose an in-plane electric field as a control parameter. This field induces hybridisation between even- and odd-parity excitons, and the resulting level repulsion effectively enhances binding energy. We argue that this mechanism is generic to excitons in semiconductors and illustrate it with a model of biased bilayer graphene. Bilayer graphene is chosen since it has a tunable band gap, making it an excitonic condensate candidate and moreover, the Zener tunnelling rate contains, in addition to the usual exponential decay, a non-standard oscillating component -- thanks to details of the electron dispersion. Analogous to quantum oscillations, we propose that Fourier spectrum of the current-voltage data allows for a novel test of exciton condensation. Finally, we show that the is a large excitonic gap to critical temperature ratio -- a clear prediction for STM studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08402v1

Zhao,2025-06-09,"We report transport studies of hybrid Josephson junctions based on semiconducting InAs nanowires with fully overlapping epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator EuS and superconducting Al partial shells. Current-biased measurements reveal a hysteretic superconducting window with a sizable supercurrent near the coercive field of the ferromagnetic insulator, accompanied by multiple Andreev reflections. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a superconducting gap characterized by three peaks, which we attribute to tunneling between exchange-split superconductors. A theoretical model reproduces the observed features and indicates that spin mixing, driven by sizable spin-orbit coupling, is essential to their formation.

2506.08204v1,Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor,Alexander von Hoegen,2025-06-09,"The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08204v1

The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has emerged as a compelling example of this class, garnering widespread interest for its remarkable temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, which features a field-induced first-order superconductor-to-superconductor phase transition with nontrivial dependence on the field direction and high critical fields, as well as antiferromagnetic and potentially higher multipole orders. To investigate the complex interplay of the ordered phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we develop a theoretical framework based on symmetry analysis combined with Bogoliubov--de Gennes and Landau methods. This approach allows us to propose probable symmetries of the superconducting states and elucidate their close relationship with magnetism. Intriguingly, we find that the first-order transition can be interpreted as a transition between coexistence phases of the same symmetry but with distinct admixtures of individual superconducting order parameters. This line may end in a critical endpoint below the superconducting critical temperature. Our approach accurately reproduces current experimental phase diagrams for varying temperature as well as out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic field, both if the transition to a magnetic phase occurs below the superconducting critical temperature and if it occurs above. Furthermore, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat and compare these quantities to recent experimental results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08097v1
2506.08095v1,Altermagnet-Superconductor Heterostructure: a Scalable Platform for Braiding of Majorana Modes,Themba Hodge,2025-06-09,"Topological quantum computation, featuring qubits built out of anyonic excitations known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), have long presented an exciting pathway towards scalable quantum computation. Recently, the advent of altermagnetic materials has presented a new pathway towards localized MZMs on the boundary of two-dimensional materials, consisting of an altermagnetic film, subject to a superconducting proximity effect from a superconducting substrate. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the N\'eel vector. Using this mechanism, on a square platform, we utilize a time-dependent method to simulate the Z-gate via braiding, and then extend this to a larger H-junction, where we implement the $\sqrt{X}$ and $\sqrt{Z}$ gate on a single-qubit system. Further, this structure is eminently scalable to many-qubit systems, thus providing the essential ingredients towards universal quantum computation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08095v1
2506.08087v1,Emblems of pair density waves: dual identity of topological defects and their transport signatures,Omri Lesser,2025-06-09,"The pair density wave (PDW) exemplifies intertwined orders in strongly correlated systems. A recent discovery of superconductivity in a quarter-metal state offers the first experimental system where a pure PDW without uniform superconductivity is suspected, offering a unique opportunity to examine the consequences of intertwined orders. A pure two-dimensional PDW supports an unusual fractional excitation as its topological defect (TD). A TD simultaneously winds the phase of the Cooper pair and distorts the amplitude modulation -- a dual role reflecting its intertwined character. As a vortex, a TD carries fractional vorticity of $\frac{1}{3} h/2e$, whose movement would cause resistance. As a crystalline defect, a TD can be sourced by charge disorder in the system. We show that experimentally observed resistive switching can originate from mobile TDs, while a small magnetic field will restore zero resistance by blocking their motion. The resulting resistive state exhibits extreme anisotropy and a Hall response, with the Hall angle determined by the angle between the current and the TD's Burgers vector. These features will serve as confirmation of the dual identity of topological defects as emblems of PDW order.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08087v1
2506.08000v1,Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators,Fabian Pichler,2025-06-09,"Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08000v1

In this paper, I point out that related phenomena occur intrinsically in bismuth-based cuprate superconductors due to the presence of the BiO supermodulation. As the ratio of the supermodulation potential to the superconducting energy gap increases, two critical points are found where semi-Dirac nodes form (that is, that have quadratic dispersion in one direction and liner dispersion in the orthogonal direction). The first critical point should be realized in Bi2212, the second in Bi2201. Implications of these findings are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07862v1

We find a leading $s^\pm$ superconducting instability in this model and show that this state primarily arises from interlayer pairing in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital that is driven by strong interlayer spin-fluctuations in that orbital. These results provide non-perturbative evidence supporting the picture that a simple single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model for the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital provides an excellent low-energy effective description of the superconducting behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07741v1

Zuev,2025-06-09,We develop a phenomenological theory describing the interaction of superconducting condensate with a Bessel beam of twisted light characterized by a nonzero angular momentum $m$. Starting from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model with the complex relaxation time we calculate the spatial profiles of dc photoinduced currents and magnetic fields as well as the second harmonic response. The photocurrents and magnetic fileds are shown to be determined both by the helicity of light and its orbital momentum $m$.

Hirsch,2025-06-09,"We consider a type I superconducting body that contains one or more holes in its interior that undergoes a transition between normal and superconducting states in the presence of a magnetic field. We argue that unlike other thermodynamic systems that undergo first order phase transitions the system cannot reach its equilibrium thermodynamic state, and that this sheds new light on the physics of the Meissner effect. How the Meissner effect occurs has not been addressed within the conventional theory of superconductivity, BCS. The situation considered in this paper indicates that expulsion of magnetic field requires physical elements absent from Hamiltonians assumed to describe superconductors within BCS theory. These physical elements are essential components of the alternative theory of hole superconductivity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07361v1
2506.07354v1,Dual-mode superconducting diode effect enabled by in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field,Chengyu Yan,2025-06-09,"The discovery of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has been cherished as a milestone in developing superconducting electronics. Tremendous efforts are being dedicated to realizing SDE in a wide variety of material platforms. Despite the diversity in the hosting materials and device designs, SDE is usually operated in a single mode which is enabled by either out-of-plane or in-plane magnetic field/magnetization. In this work, we report the realization of a dual-mode SDE in 2H-$\mathrm{NbS_2}$/2H-$\mathrm{NbSe_2}$ heterostructures where both the out-of-plane magnetic field $B_{\perp}$ and in-plane magnetic field $B_{||}$ can independently generate and manipulate SDE. The two modes share similar diode efficiency but differ in two aspects: 1. $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE is activated by a field on the order of 1 mT while $B_{||}$-induced SDE requires a field on the order of 100 mT; 2. $\eta$ of $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE exhibits a square-root like temperature dependence while $\eta$ of $B_{||}$-induced SDE takes a more linear-like one. We demonstrate that the dual-mode SDE is most likely a result of mirror symmetry breaking along multiple orientations. Thanks to the two orders difference in the operational field for the two modes, we propose a dual-functionality device scheme to showcase the potential of the dual-mode SDE in realizing advanced superconducting architecture, where fast polarity-switching functionality is implemented with $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE and high-fidelity functionality is enabled with $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07354v1

The charactristic features of these theories are the existence of long range magnetic order and the spin-spin interaction described by the exchange of the messenger bosons, not by the instantaneous action at a distance. These theories could play important roles in our understanding of non-Abelian condensed matters and make the non-Abelian gauge interaction a main stream in the low energy physics.

Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07095v1

Here, we integrated the high-precision angle-resolved resistivity (ARR) measurement with a rotatable in-plane magnetic field to systematically study the angular dependence of superconducting fluctuations in optimally doped La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 (LSCO). By independently controlling the directions of the current and the magnetic field, we are able to isolate the magneto-resistivity contributed by the superconducting vortex motion and distinguish excitations from nematic superconductivity and d-wave superconductive order based on their respective C2 and C4 symmetries. Signatures of two intertwined superconductive orders are also evident in the measured angular dependence of the critical current. A T-B phase diagram of different types of superconducting fluctuations is determined.

2506.06257v1,Tuning of altermagnetism by strain,M. Khodas,2025-06-06,"For all collinear altermagnets, we sort out piezomagnetic free-energy invariants allowed in the nonrelativistic limit and relativistic piezomagnetic invariants bilinear in the N\'eel vector $\mathbf{L}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, which include strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The symmetry-allowed responses are fully determined by the nonrelativistic spin Laue group. In the nonrelativistic limit, two distinct mechanisms are discussed: the band-filling mechanism, which exists in metals and is illustrated using the simple two-dimensional Lieb lattice model, and the temperature-dependent exchange-driven mechanism, which is illustrated using first-principles calculations for transition-metal fluorides. The leading second-order nonrelativistic term in the strain-induced magnetization is also obtained for CrSb. Piezomagnetism due to the strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is calculated from first principles for transition-metal fluorides, MnTe, and CrSb. Finally, we discuss triplet superconducting correlations supported by altermagnets and protected by inversion rather than time-reversal symmetry. We apply the nonrelativistic classification of Cooper pairs to describe the interplay between strain and superconductivity in the two-dimensional Lieb lattice and in bulk rutile structures. We show that triplet superconductivity is, on average, unitary in an unstrained altermagnet, but becomes non-unitary under piezomagnetically active strain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06257v1

We predict that in superconductors this cavity-enhanced coupling enables the control of the order-parameter stiffness, which governs key length scales such as the coherence length of Cooper pairs and the magnetic penetration depth. We explain this as a renormalization of the Cooper-pair mass caused by photon-mediated repulsive interactions between the electrons building the pair. The strength of this effect can be tuned via the length of the cavity and we estimate it to be sizable for cavities in the infrared range.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06140v1

These dynamical sweet spots are induced by an externally applied Floquet drive, and various drive forms have been studied in different types of qubits. In this work we study the effects of using two-tone drives on the applied magnetic flux of the form $\phi_{ac}(t)=\phi_m\cos(m\omega_\mathrm{d} t)+\phi_n\cos(n\omega_\mathrm{d} t+\varphi)$, where $m,n \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$, on the coherence times of fluxonium qubits. The optimal drive parameters are found through analysis using perturbation theory and numerical calculations. We show that this type of drive allows for more tunability of the quasi-energy spectrum, creating higher and wider peaks of the dephasing time without affecting the relaxation times too strongly. Further we show that the second commensurable drive tone can be used to implement an improved phase gate compared to implementations with a single tone, supported by Monte Carlo simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06002v1

Our results demonstrate that the anisotropic pinning potential gives rise to distinct critical temperatures and upper critical fields along two orthogonal directions of current transport.

Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts a nonreciprocal superconducting state of the axionic subtype, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05550v1
2506.05003v1,Engineering harmonic emission through spatial modulation in a Kitaev chain,Nivash R.,2025-06-05,"We investigate High-harmonic generation (HHG) in a dimerized Kitaev chain. The dimerization in the model is introduced through a site-dependent modulating potential, determined by a parameter $\lambda \in [-1:1]$. This parameter also determines the strength of the hopping amplitudes and tunes the system's topology. Depending upon the parameter $\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can be classified into three segments. The first segment exhibits two plateau structures, with the dominant one resulting from transitions to the chiral partner state, consistent with quasiparticle behavior in the topological superconducting phase. The second segment displays multiple plateaus, where intermediate states enable various transition pathways to higher conduction bands. Finally, the third segment presents broader plateaus, indicative of active interband transitions. In the $\lambda\leq0$ regime, we observe the mid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed harmonic enhancements. This highlights the key role of the intermediate states, particularly when MGSs are isolated. These results demonstrate that harmonic emission profiles can be selectively controlled through the modulating parameter $\lambda$, offering new prospects for tailoring HHG in topological systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05003v1
2506.04766v1,Impact of border defects on the magnetic flux penetration in superconducting films,Alejandro V. Silhanek,2025-06-05,"Defects in superconducting systems are ubiquitous and nearly unavoidable. They can vary in nature, geometry, and size, ranging from microscopic-size defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, twin planes, and oxygen vacancies, to macroscopic-size defects such as segregations, indentations, contamination, cracks, or voids. Irrespective of their type, defects perturb the otherwise laminar flow of electric current, forcing it to deviate from its path. In the best-case scenario, the associated perturbation can be damped within a distance of the order of the size of the defect if the rigidity of the superconducting state, characterized by the creep exponent $n$, is low. In most cases, however, this perturbation spans macroscopic distances covering the entire superconducting sample and thus dramatically influences the response of the system. In this work, we review the current state of theoretical understanding and experimental evidence on the modification of magnetic flux patterns in superconductors by border defects, including the influence of their geometry, temperature, and applied magnetic field. We scrutinize and contrast the picture emerging from a continuous media standpoint, i.e. ignoring the granularity imposed by the vortex quantization, with that provided by a phenomenological approach dictated by the vortex dynamics. In addition, we discuss the influence of border indentations on the nucleation of thermomagnetic instabilities. Assessing the impact of surface and border defects is of utmost importance for all superconducting technologies, including superconducting resonators, superconducting single-photon detectors, superconducting radio-frequency cavities and accelerators, superconducting cables, superconducting metamaterials, superconducting diodes, and many others.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04766v1

In this work the structural morphological and superconducting properties have been studied for Mo2N thin films deposited via direct current magnetron sputtering on cplane Al2O3 and MgO substrates to elucidate the effect of internal strain on superconducting properties. High resolution X Ray diffraction and time of flight elastic recoil detection analysis confirms the growth of single phase Mo2N thin films exhibiting epitaxial growth with twin domain structure. Low temperature electrical transport measurements reveal superconducting transitions at 5.2 K and 5.6 K with corresponding upper critical fields of 5 T and 7 T for the films deposited on Al2O3 and MgO, respectively. These results indicate strong type II superconductivity and the observed differences in superconducting properties are attributed to substrate induced strain which leads to higher e ph coupling for the film on MgO substrate.

Here, we employ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant X-ray scattering at a free-electron laser to probe the transient electronic density of states and ultrafast CO dynamics in overdoped (Bi,Pb)$_{2.12}$Sr$_{1.88}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$. We reveal a striking pump laser wavelength dependence - the 800 nm light fails to suppress CO, whereas the 400 nm light effectively melts it. This behavior originates from the fact that 400 nm photons can promote electrons from the Zhang-Rice singlet band to the upper Hubbard band or apical oxygen states, while 800 nm photons lack the energy to excite electrons across the charge-transfer gap. The CO recovery time ($\sim$3 ps) matches that of the underdoped cuprates, indicating universal electronic instability in the phase diagram. Additionally, melting overdoped CO requires an order-of-magnitude higher fluence highlighting the role of lattice interactions.

2506.04601v1,Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5,Jun Ge,2025-06-05,"Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04601v1

Because of the non-trivial sublattice structure of the altermagnetic order, shorter-range and longer-range fluctuations favor qualitatively different types of pairing states. Specifically, while the latter stabilize a standard spin-triplet $p$-wave state, just like ferromagnetic fluctuations, the former leads to intra-unit-cell pairing, in which the Cooper pairs are formed by electrons from different sublattices. The symmetry of the intra-unit-cell gap function can be not only $p$-wave, but also spin-singlet $s$-wave and $d$-wave, depending on the shape of the Fermi surface. We also show that coexistence with altermagnetic order promotes intrinsic non-trivial topology, such as protected Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces and higher-order topological superconductivity.

The ability to move the MBS on a two-dimensional platform such as a planar Josephson junction is practically constrained by a fixed direction of applied magnetic field. In addition, the detrimental effects of the magnetic field on proximity-induced superconductivity in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures is an outstanding problem for the realization of topological superconductivity. Here we show that these problems can be solved in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which generates the MBS without the need of any external magnetic field, phase biasing, and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using a high-temperature superconductor having $d$-wave pairing symmetry, we confirm that our planar junction can support the MBS at high temperatures. We propose protocols for performing non-trivial fusion, exchange and non-Abelian braiding of multiple MBS in our field-free platforms. The proposed geometries and MBS movement protocols open a path towards successful experimental detection of the MBS via confirmation of their non-Abelian statistics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04338v1

Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03975v2

While aluminum (Al)-based hybrid nanowire devices have been widely utilized, their limited superconducting gap and intrinsic weak SOC as well as small Land\'e g-factor may hinder future experimental advancements. In contrast, we demonstrate that lead (Pb)-based hybrid quantum devices exhibit a remarkably large and hard proximity-induced superconducting gap, exceeding that of Al by an order of magnitude. By exploiting electrostatic gating to modulate wavefunction distribution and SC-SM interfacial coupling, this gap can be continuously tuned from its maximum value (~1.4 meV, matching the bulk Pb gap) down to nearly zero while maintaining the hardness. Furthermore, magnetic-field-dependent measurements reveal a radial evolution of the gap structure with anti-crossing feature, indicative of strong SOC and huge effective g-factors up to 76.

The latter indicates the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and, thus, unconventional SC in both compounds. Previous temperature-dependent muon-spin spectroscopy studies failed to distinguish whether such compounds exhibit single-gap or multi-gap SC. Here, we report on systematic measurements of the field-dependent muon-spin relaxation rates in the superconducting state and on temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and specific heat under applied magnetic fields. Both the upper critical field and the field-dependent superconducting relaxation are well described by a two-band model.
